## Snapshots

Snapshots can be used to capture the state of a PVC at a given point of time. Following objects are important when working with snapshots:

### VolumeSnapshot

A VolumeSnapshot defines a users request to snapshot a PVC. Let's take an example:

```text
apiVersion: volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: mysql-snapshot
  namespace: default
spec:
  persistentVolumeClaimName: mysql-data
```

In above spec,

* **persistentVolumeClaimName: mysql-data** indicates that user wants to snapshot the *mysql-data* PVC.

### GroupVolumeSnapshot

A GroupVolumeSnapshot defines a users request to snapshot a group of PVCs. Portworx will quiesce IO on all volumes in the group and then trigger the snapshot.

Let's take an example:

```text
apiVersion: stork.libopenstorage.org/v1alpha1
kind: GroupVolumeSnapshot
metadata:
  name: mysql-group-snap
spec:
  pvcSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
```

In above spec,

* **pvcSelector** specifies a label selector which will match all PVCs that have the label *app=mysql*.

{{<info>}}For single or group snapshots, it is possible to backup the volumes to a cloud S3 endpoint instead of disks on the local cluster. The [Create snapshots](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/create-snapshots/) page has details on taking snapshots of Portworx volumes.{{</info>}}

### Application consistency when taking snapshots

For each of the snapshot types, Portworx supports specifying pre and post rules that are run on the application pods using the volumes. This allows users to quiesce the applications before the snapshot is taken and resume I/O after the snapshot is taken. The commands will be run in pods which are using the PVC being snapshotted.

## Migration

Migration is reffered to the operation of transferring application workloads (e.g Deployments, Statefulsets, Jobs, ConfigMaps etc) and their data (PVCs) across Kubernetes clusters.

Common use cases for this would be:

* Augment capacity: Free capacity on critical clusters by evacuating lower priority applications to secondary clusters.
* Blue-green test: Validate new versions of Kubernetes and/or Portworx using both application and its data. This is the same blue-green approach used by cloud-native application teamsâ€“ now available for your infrastructure.
* Dev/test: Promote workloads from dev to staging clusters in an automated manner. Thereby, eliminate the manual steps for data preparation that hurt fidelity of tests.
* Lift/Shift: Move applications and data from an on-prem cluster to a hosted AWS EKS or Google GKE. The reverse is also supported to repatriate, move applications on-prem.
* Maintenance: Decommission a cluster in order to perform hardware-level upgrades.

Portworx uses [STORK](https://github.com/libopenstorage/stork) for migration. The [Migration](/concepts/migration) page detailed documentation on this.
